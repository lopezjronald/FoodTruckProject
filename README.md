# Food Truck Project - Week 2 Skill Distillery

## Overview
The food truck app creates an object using FoodTruck and promts to input the name, food type, and rating for up to five food trucks. The truck id is automatically generated in the FoodTruck constructor from a static field. If user enters "N" in any case, it goes to the next question where it can prompt the user to exit the application. Instead of displaying a menu, I accidentally prompted the user whether they would like to see the average rating, highest rating, or quit the program.

## Technologies Used:
- IntelliJ
- Eclipse
- Java
- Terminal Commands
- GitHub/Git

## Lessons Learned
This project was pretty challenging. One area I was stuck in was generating an incremental number.This is my second attempt and being able to focus on the instructions and knowing what the application is supposed to do and the outcome it is expected to produce, it really helped me narrow my focus on meeting the requirements.
